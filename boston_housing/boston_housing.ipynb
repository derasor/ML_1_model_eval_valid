    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**RM:** Usually neighborhoods where properties are more expensive have larger houses. Since the number of rooms of a house is a good proxy to size, I would argue that a house located in a neighborhood where the average number of rooms is large, is more likely to be more expensive. Thus, _an increase in RM would lead to an increase in MEDV._\n",
    "\n",
    "**LSTAT:** Usually people with lower incomes are not homeowners in neighborhoods where homes are more valuable. If the percentage of homeowners belonging to a lower economic status in a given neighborhood is large, it is more probable that a house in this neighborhood is cheaper. Thus, _an increase in LSTAT would lead to a decrease in MEDV._\n",
    "\n",
    "**PTRATIO:** Usually, well off neighborhoods have a good educational offer for primary and secondary schools. This is represented in infrastructure, and also a good ratio of students to teachers, among other things. If there is a relatively large ratio of students to teachers in a given neighborhood, this means that there is probably a shortage of teachers and thus that this may not be a choice for families that value highly a good education for their children. Since demand for houses in such neighborhoods is diminished, _an increase in PTRATIO would lead to a decrease in MEDV._"

    "Training score tends to decrease as more training points are added, since it is easier for the learning algorithm (in this case a decision tree) to fit into a smaller dataset. Testing score tends to increase as more training points are added, since a larger training set implies a better generalization, which is what we are looking for when trying to use the model to predict the target variable on new data. \n",

In this case it seems that an optimal trade off has been achieved compared to the other three cases, and adding more training points would not be justified since the marginal change on both training and testing scores is minimal.  \n",

    "When maximum depth = 1, scores also converge but to a very low R<sup>2</sup> of around 0.42, so in this case there is underfitting. For maximum depths 6 and 10 the training score doesn't decreases as much when more training points are added, but the testing score seems to be restricted to lower values of performance regardless of training size, so overfitting starts to take place.

    "When the model is trained with maximum depth 1, both the training and validation scores have a very low performance; thus, the model is not able to represent the underlying complexity. In this case the cause of error is _bias_, or underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is trained with maximum depth 10, the training score is almost perfect; i.e. the model has learned the training data to almost a perfect fit. However, the testing score is diverging from the training score after  around maximum depth 4, and at maximum depth 10 has the worst performance that the graph shows. In this case the model is losing its ability to generalize, and in this case tha cause of error is _variance_, or overfitting."

    "Some learning algorithm will be used to make the prediction we are looking for. This algorithm has a set of parameters that specify its approach to learning from the dataset, and ultimately generalizing to make predictions. Given a dataset, different combinations of parameters yield different performances. This is why it is good practice to explore automatically different sets of parameters to optimize the performance of the estimator. [Grid search](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/grid_search.html#grid-search) is a technique in which a _grid_ of different values of one or various parameters of the learning algorithm in question is tested. By choosing the best performing parameter values combination, the performance of the model is improved.  "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the [scikit-learn documentation for Cross-validation ](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html), \"When evaluating different settings (“hyperparameters”) for estimators... there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally\". To solve this problem, the dataset can be splitted in three subsets; the training and testing subsets, plus a validation subset. The parameter optmization can be implemented on the validation subset, and the final model evaluation can be then safely done on the testing subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of splitting the initial dataset in three subsets is that all subsets are further reduced in number of samples. This increases the risk that the randomly chosen partitions don't reflect well the underlying model. In the k-fold cross-validation, instead of making use of a validation subset, the dataset is split into k sets, and iteratively k-1 sets are used for training and the remaining one is left for testing. This procedure ensures a training procedure that allows for parameter optimization without overfitting."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_iter'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",

    "Although prices have been scaled to account for inflation, this dataset is too old to be used in a real-world setting. Inflation is only one of several factors affecting the real estate market of a city like Boston. Also, the fact that many variables have been excluded for the specific purpose of this project to focus on model evaluation and validation makes the dataset poor in features. There is also the possibility that features important to predict selling prices today, in Boston, were not included in the initial dataset. \n",

    "Aditionally, it can be argued that the model doesn't seem robust enough to make consistent predictions. This can be documented by the fact that the range in prices in the Sensitivity section above is 0.22 standard deviations of our initial dataset for 10 trials. Setting an initial selling price of \\$391,183.33 may be very different than setting it at \\$428,316.00. Although this is subjective I would prefer a Sensitivity range of prices no larger than 0.1 (\\$16,500) standard deviations of our initial dataset.\n",
